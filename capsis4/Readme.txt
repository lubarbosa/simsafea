Overview
--------

Hi-sAFe is a mechanistic, biophysical model designed to explore the interactions within agroforestry systems that mix trees with crops. The model couples the pre-existing STICS crop model to a new tree model that includes several plasticity mechanisms responsive to tree-tree and tree-crop competition. Trees and crops compete in 3D for light, water and nitrogen at a daily time step. The model is driven by daily meteorological data. Modeled system geometry can be custom built using a grid of square cells and flexible boundary conditions, permitting the simulation of isolated trees, tree lines, stand edges, and a wide range of agroforestry patterns. Parallel instances of the crop model on each cell simulate spatially explicit crop growth in relation to tree location. An opportunistic tree growth module accounts for the impact of resource availability on tree root architecture. Monoculture crop and tree systems can also be simulated, enabling calculation of the land equivalent ratio of agroforestry systems. Closure of the light, water and nitrogen budgets ensures energy and mass conservation in the system. Hi-sAFe is a novel tool for elucidating daily interactions for light, water, and nitrogen in agroforestry systems. Its 3D and spatially explicit form is key for accurately representing many competition and facilitation processes. Hi-sAFe can be used to explore:

-   agroforestry designs (e.g. tree spacing, crop type, tree row orientation)
-   management strategies (e.g. thinning, branch pruning, root pruning, fertilization, irrigation)
-   responses to environmental variation (e.g. climate change, soil depth, soil structure and fertility, fluctuating water table, latitude)

If you are new to Hi-sAFe, the best way to start is with the two foundational publications on Hi-sAFe:
